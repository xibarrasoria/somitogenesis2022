### Peak calling in individual ATAC-seq samples

One way to assess the signal-to-noise ratio of individual ATAC-seq samples is to call peaks. Those with large number of peaks called have significant signal outside background regions. This can be used as a quality-control metric.

To call peaks we use `MACS2`, in paired-end mode (which automatically disables the model building and extension parameters). We use the algorithm in *broad* mode since ATAC-seq peaks resemble more histone marks rather than TFs.

```{bash}
sh 02.1_callPeaks_individualReps.sh
```

The output peak calls are stored in `ATAC-seq/peaks/individualReps/` and are used for sample quality-control (see `ATAC-seq/scripts/dataAnalysis/02_qualityControl.md` for details).
