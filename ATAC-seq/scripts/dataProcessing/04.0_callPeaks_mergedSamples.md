### Peak calling with merged ATAC-seq samples

After performing QC of the ATAC-seq data, we have retained 50 of the 75 samples that are of good quality.

For downstream analyses we will focus only in regions of enriched signal, to reduce the search space. For this, we can call peaks to obtain such regions.

Since one of the analyses we are interested in is to identify differentially accessible peaks across time and space, the definition of the peaks should be agnostic to such variables. Thus, we combine all 50 samples and use them as merged input for `MACS2`.

```{bash}
sh 04.1_callPeaks_mergedSamples.sh 
```

As a control, we also call peaks on a per-stage basis, to ensure that by merging everything we are not loosing stage-specific peaks.

```{bash}
sh 04.2_callPeaks_mergedSamples_perStage.sh
```
